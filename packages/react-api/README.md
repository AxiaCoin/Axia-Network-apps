WARNING: This is is not deemed stable yet for external use in React-based apps and still included in the [axia-js/apps](https://github.com/axia-js/apps) repo. Since these are generic HOC components for React, they will move to the [axia-js/ui](https://github.com/axia-js/ui) repo once deemed stable and usable by external projects.

For the existing sharable components usable in external React-based projects, take a look at the [axia-js/ui documentation](https://axia.js.org/ui/)
